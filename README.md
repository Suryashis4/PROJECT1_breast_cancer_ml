# Breast Cancer Prediction using Machine Learning

## 📌 Overview
This project is an AI-powered system that predicts whether a tumor is *malignant (cancerous) or benign (non-cancerous)* using machine learning. The model is trained on the *Wisconsin Breast Cancer Dataset (WBCD)* and utilizes a *Random Forest Classifier* for high accuracy. The system features a *Streamlit-based UI* for easy data entry and batch processing via Excel files.

## 🎯 Objectives
- ✅ *Accurate Tumor Classification* – Distinguish between malignant and benign tumors.
- ✅ *User-Friendly Interface* – Enable easy data entry via *Streamlit*.
- ✅ *Batch Predictions* – Predict outcomes for multiple patients using *Excel files*.
- ✅ *Downloadable Results* – Provide an option to download predictions for analysis.

## 📊 Dataset Details
- *Source*: Wisconsin Breast Cancer Dataset (WBCD)
- *Features (30 total)*:
  - Mean, Standard Error, and Worst Values for:
    - 🔹 Radius, Texture, Perimeter, Area, Smoothness, Compactness
    - 🔹 Concavity, Concave Points, Symmetry, Fractal Dimension
- *Target Variable*:
  - *0 → Benign* (Non-Cancerous)
  - *1 → Malignant* (Cancerous)

---

## ⚙ Technologies Used
- 🔹 *Python* (Machine Learning & Streamlit)
- 🔹 *Pandas, NumPy* (Data Processing)
- 🔹 *Scikit-Learn* (ML Model Training)
- 🔹 *Streamlit* (Web-Based UI)
- 🔹 *OpenPyXL* (Excel File Handling for Batch Processing)

## 🚀 How It Works
1️⃣ *Data Preprocessing*  
   - Load dataset, handle missing values, and scale features.  
2️⃣ *Model Training*  
   - Train *Random Forest Classifier* with optimal hyperparameters.  
3️⃣ *Streamlit UI Development*  
   - Allow *manual input & file upload* for predictions.  
4️⃣ *Prediction & Output*  
   - Display *live results* and allow downloading of predictions.
